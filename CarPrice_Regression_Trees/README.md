## Car Price Prediction: Regression and Trees

**Objective:** Predict the price of used cars (`Price`) using linear regression and decision tree models.

**Files:**
- `CarPrice_Analysis.qmd`: Quarto Markdown file for the analysis.
- `CarPrice_Analysis.html`: Rendered HTML report with visualizations and insights.
- `ToyotaCorolla.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Summary statistics and visualizations of variables.
   - Analysis of relationships between features and `Price`.

2. **Model Building:**
   - **Linear Regression:** Establishes a baseline using linear relationships.
   - **Decision Tree:** Captures non-linear relationships and identifies important features.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Comparison of metrics (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²).
   - Insights into the strengths and limitations of each model.

**Key Insights:**
- Linear regression offers a simple baseline but struggles with non-linear relationships.
- Decision trees effectively identify key features impacting `Price`.

**Tools Used:** R, Quarto, ggplot2, rpart.
