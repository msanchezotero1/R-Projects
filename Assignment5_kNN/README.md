## Assignment 5: kNN Regression and Classification

**Objective:** Explore k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for regression and classification tasks.

**Files:**
- `Assignment5_kNN.qmd`: Quarto Markdown file for the analysis.
- `Assignment5_kNN.html`: Rendered HTML report with visualizations and insights.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Summary statistics and visualizations.
   - Understanding relationships between variables.
2. **kNN Modeling:**
   - Applied kNN for regression and classification.
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy and RMSE.
3. **Insights:**
   - kNN is a flexible model but can be sensitive to hyperparameter tuning.

**Tools Used:** R, Quarto, `caret` package, visualization libraries.
